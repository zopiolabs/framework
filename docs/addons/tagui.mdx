### Installation

To install TagUI, you can download it directly from the GitHub repository:

```sh Terminal
# For Windows users, download and extract the ZIP file
# For macOS/Linux users:
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aisingapore/TagUI/master/src/setup/install.sh)"
```

### Usage

TagUI uses a simple language designed specifically for RPA. Here's an example of automating a login process:

```typescript tagui-login-example.txt
// Navigate to the login page
https://login.example.com

// Enter credentials using web identifiers
type email as user@example.com
type password as securepassword
click login

// Wait for dashboard to load
wait 2 seconds

// Capture a screenshot
snap page to dashboard.png

// Extract data from a table
table 1 to data.csv
```

You can also use image recognition to interact with UI elements:

```typescript tagui-visual-example.txt
// Use image snapshots to identify UI elements
type email_field.png as user@example.com
type password_field.png as securepassword
click login_button.png

// Use OCR to read text from the screen
read success_message to result
echo `Login result: ${result}`
```

### Excel Integration

TagUI makes it easy to work with Excel files:

```typescript tagui-excel-example.txt
// Read data from Excel
customer_name = [customers.xlsx]Sheet1!A2
customer_email = [customers.xlsx]Sheet1!B2

// Navigate to customer portal
https://portal.example.com

// Use the Excel data in your automation
type name as `{customer_name}`
type email as `{customer_email}`

// Write results back to Excel
[results.xlsx]Summary!A1 = "Process completed"
[results.xlsx]Summary!B1 = now()
```
