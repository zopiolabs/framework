# Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

The `@repo/auth-abac` package extends the role-based access control system provided by `@repo/auth-rbac` with attribute-based access control capabilities. This allows for even more granular and dynamic permission rules based on attributes of users, resources, and the environment.

## Overview

ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) is an authorization model that evaluates permissions based on attributes associated with the user, the resource, the action, and the environment. Unlike RBAC, which assigns permissions based solely on roles, ABAC allows for more context-aware and fine-grained access decisions.

Key features include:

- **Attribute-based conditions**: Define access rules based on user and resource attributes
- **Seamless integration with RBAC**: Combine with existing role-based rules
- **Flexible rule evaluation**: Apply complex logic using user context and resource data
- **Scalable authorization logic**: Create modular and maintainable permission rules

## Installation

The package is included in the zopio stack. If you need to install it separately:

```bash
pnpm add @repo/auth-abac
```

## Configuration

### Defining ABAC Rules

ABAC rules follow the same structure as RBAC rules but focus on attribute-based conditions:

```typescript
import { PermissionRule } from "@repo/auth-rbac";

export const abacRules: PermissionRule[] = [
  {
    resource: "invoices",
    action: "read",
    condition: (ctx, record) => ctx.region === record.region
  },
  {
    resource: "payments",
    action: "approve",
    condition: (ctx, record) => ctx.clearanceLevel >= 3
  }
];
```

### Combining with RBAC Rules

You can combine ABAC rules with existing RBAC rules for a comprehensive authorization strategy:

```typescript
import { rules as rbacRules } from "@repo/auth-rbac";
import { abacRules } from "@repo/auth-abac";

export const combinedRules = [...rbacRules, ...abacRules];
```

Then use the combined rules with the existing evaluation engine:

```typescript
import { evaluateAccess } from "@repo/auth-rbac";

const result = evaluateAccess({
  rules: combinedRules,
  context: userContext,
  resource: "invoices",
  action: "read",
  record: invoice
});

if (result.can) {
  // User has permission to read this invoice
}
```

## Common ABAC Patterns

### Resource Ownership

Restrict access to resources based on ownership:

```typescript
{
  resource: "documents",
  action: "update",
  condition: (ctx, record) => record.ownerId === ctx.userId
}
```

### Geographic Restrictions

Limit access based on geographic location:

```typescript
{
  resource: "content",
  action: "view",
  condition: (ctx, record) => record.allowedRegions.includes(ctx.region)
}
```

### Time-Based Access

Grant access only during specific time periods:

```typescript
{
  resource: "system",
  action: "maintenance",
  condition: (ctx) => {
    const currentHour = new Date().getHours();
    return currentHour >= 22 || currentHour < 6; // Only during off-hours
  }
}
```

### Security Clearance Levels

Implement hierarchical security clearances:

```typescript
{
  resource: "classified",
  action: "read",
  condition: (ctx, record) => ctx.clearanceLevel >= record.requiredClearance
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Balance RBAC and ABAC**: Use RBAC for coarse-grained permissions and ABAC for fine-grained control
2. **Keep conditions simple**: Complex conditions can be difficult to maintain and debug
3. **Consider performance**: Evaluate the performance impact of complex attribute checks
4. **Test thoroughly**: Create comprehensive tests for your authorization rules
5. **Document attributes**: Maintain clear documentation of all attributes used in access decisions

## Example: Complete ABAC Implementation

Here's a complete example of implementing ABAC in a zopio application:

```typescript
// Define user context type with additional attributes
type EnhancedUserContext = {
  userId: string;
  role: string;
  tenantId: string;
  department: string;
  region: string;
  clearanceLevel: number;
};

// Define ABAC rules
const abacRules: PermissionRule[] = [
  {
    resource: "reports",
    action: "view",
    condition: (ctx: EnhancedUserContext, record) => {
      // Department-specific reports
      if (record.departmentOnly) {
        return ctx.department === record.department;
      }
      
      // Region-restricted reports
      if (record.regionRestricted) {
        return record.allowedRegions.includes(ctx.region);
      }
      
      // Classified reports
      if (record.classification) {
        return ctx.clearanceLevel >= record.classification;
      }
      
      return true; // No restrictions
    }
  }
];

// Combine with existing RBAC rules
import { rules as rbacRules } from "./rbacRules";
export const combinedRules = [...rbacRules, ...abacRules];
```

## Integration with Middleware and Hooks

The ABAC rules work seamlessly with the existing middleware and hooks from `@repo/auth-rbac`:

```typescript
import { withAuthorization } from "@repo/auth-rbac";
import { combinedRules } from "./authRules";

// API route protection with combined RBAC and ABAC rules
export const GET = withAuthorization({
  resource: "reports",
  action: "view",
  rules: combinedRules
})(async (req) => {
  // This code only runs if the user has permission
  const reports = await db.reports.findMany();
  return Response.json(reports);
});
```

```tsx
import { useAccess } from "@repo/auth-rbac";
import { combinedRules } from "./authRules";

function ReportViewer({ report }) {
  const { can } = useAccess({
    rules: combinedRules,
    resource: "reports",
    action: "view",
    record: report
  });

  if (!can) {
    return <p>You don't have permission to view this report.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{report.title}</h1>
      <p>{report.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
