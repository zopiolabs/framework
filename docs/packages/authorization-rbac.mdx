# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The `@zopio/auth-rbac` package provides a flexible and powerful role-based access control system for your application. It allows you to define granular permission rules based on user roles, resources, actions, and even field-level permissions.

## Overview

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users based on their role within an organization. The `@zopio/auth-rbac` package extends the authentication capabilities provided by `@zopio/auth` with robust authorization features.

Key features include:

- **Resource and action-based permissions**: Control who can perform specific actions on resources
- **Field-level permissions**: Define read/write access at the field level
- **Conditional rules**: Apply complex logic to determine access rights
- **DSL support**: Use a declarative syntax for defining access rules
- **React hooks**: Easy integration with your frontend components
- **Middleware**: Protect API routes with authorization checks

## Installation

The package is included by default in the zopio stack. If you need to install it separately:

```bash
pnpm add @zopio/auth-rbac
```

## Configuration

### Defining Rules

Authorization rules are defined in a central configuration file. Each rule specifies:

- The **resource** being accessed (e.g., "orders", "users")
- The **action** being performed (e.g., "read", "update", "delete")
- Optional **condition** function that evaluates access based on user context and record data
- Optional **field permissions** that specify read/write access to individual fields

```typescript
// Example rules configuration
import { PermissionRule } from "@zopio/auth-rbac";

export const rules: PermissionRule[] = [
  {
    resource: "orders",
    action: "read",
    condition: (ctx, record) => record.tenantId === ctx.tenantId,
    fieldPermissions: {
      id: "read",
      total: "read",
      cost: "none", // No access to this field
    },
  },
  {
    resource: "orders",
    action: "update",
    condition: (ctx, record) => record.createdBy === ctx.userId,
    fieldPermissions: {
      status: "write",
      total: "none", // Cannot modify this field
    },
  },
  {
    resource: "users",
    action: "invite",
    condition: (ctx) => ctx.role === "admin",
  },
];
```

### Using the DSL (Domain Specific Language)

For more complex access rules, you can use the DSL syntax instead of condition functions:

```typescript
{
  resource: "projects",
  action: "delete",
  dsl: {
    or: [
      { equals: ["context.role", "admin"] },
      { and: [
        { equals: ["context.role", "manager"] },
        { equals: ["record.createdBy", "context.userId"] }
      ]}
    ]
  }
}
```

## API Reference

### Middleware

Protect your API routes with the `withAuthorization` middleware:

```typescript
import { withAuthorization } from "@zopio/auth-rbac";

export const GET = withAuthorization({
  resource: "orders",
  action: "read",
})(async (req) => {
  // This code only runs if the user has permission
  const orders = await db.orders.findMany();
  return Response.json(orders);
});
```

### React Hooks

Use the `useAccess` hook in your components to conditionally render UI elements based on permissions:

```tsx
import { useAccess } from "@zopio/auth-rbac";

function OrderDetails({ order }) {
  const { can } = useAccess({
    resource: "orders",
    action: "update",
    record: order,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Order #{order.id}</h1>
      {can && (
        <button onClick={handleEdit}>Edit Order</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

For field-level permissions:

```tsx
function OrderForm({ order }) {
  const { can: canEditStatus } = useAccess({
    resource: "orders",
    action: "update",
    record: order,
    field: "status",
  });

  return (
    <form>
      <select 
        name="status" 
        disabled={!canEditStatus}
        defaultValue={order.status}
      >
        <option value="pending">Pending</option>
        <option value="shipped">Shipped</option>
        <option value="delivered">Delivered</option>
      </select>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Integration with Clerk

The package seamlessly integrates with Clerk authentication through the `@zopio/auth` package. The user context is automatically extracted from the Clerk session:

```typescript
// This is handled internally by the auth-rbac package
export async function getUserContext(req: NextRequest): Promise<UserContext> {
  const auth = getAuth(req);
  if (!auth.userId || !auth.orgId || !auth.sessionClaims?.metadata?.role) {
    throw new Error("Unauthorized or incomplete session");
  }
  return {
    userId: auth.userId,
    role: auth.sessionClaims.metadata.role,
    tenantId: auth.orgId,
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Define granular permissions**: Create specific rules for each resource and action combination
2. **Use field-level permissions**: Control access to sensitive fields
3. **Keep rules maintainable**: Group related rules and use comments to explain complex conditions
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify that your permission rules work as expected in all scenarios
5. **Consider performance**: Complex rule evaluations can impact performance, so optimize where needed

## Example: Complete Authorization Flow

Here's a complete example of how authorization works in a typical zopio application:

1. User authenticates with Clerk
2. User makes a request to a protected API route
3. The `withAuthorization` middleware extracts the user context from the Clerk session
4. The middleware evaluates the permission rules against the user context and requested resource
5. If authorized, the request proceeds; otherwise, a 401 or 403 response is returned
6. On the frontend, components use the `useAccess` hook to conditionally render UI elements based on the user's permissions

This flow ensures that authorization is consistently applied across both the backend and frontend of your application.
