# Authorization Runner For Advanced Scenarios

The `@repo/auth-runner` package provides a simplified interface for using both role-based (RBAC) and attribute-based (ABAC) access control together in your application. It serves as an integration layer that combines the functionality of both authorization systems.

## Overview

When implementing complex authorization systems, you often need to combine different authorization models. The `@repo/auth-runner` package makes this easy by:

- Combining rules from both RBAC and ABAC systems
- Providing a simplified API for authorization checks
- Abstracting away the complexity of rule management

## Installation

The package is included in the zopio stack. If you need to install it separately:

```bash
pnpm add @repo/auth-runner
```

## Usage

Using the auth-runner package is straightforward:

```typescript
import { evaluateAccess } from "@repo/auth-runner";

// Check if a user has permission
const result = evaluateAccess({
  context: userContext,
  resource: "documents",
  action: "read",
  record: document
});

if (result.can) {
  // User has permission
  // Proceed with the operation
} else {
  // Access denied
  console.log(result.reason); // Optional reason for denial
}
```

### With API Routes

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { evaluateAccess } from "@repo/auth-runner";

export async function GET(request) {
  const userContext = await getUserContext(request);
  const document = await getDocument(request);
  
  const result = evaluateAccess({
    context: userContext,
    resource: "documents",
    action: "read",
    record: document
  });
  
  if (!result.can) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Access denied", reason: result.reason },
      { status: 403 }
    );
  }
  
  // Proceed with the operation
  return NextResponse.json(document);
}
```

### With React Components

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { evaluateAccess } from "@repo/auth-runner";

function DocumentViewer({ documentId }) {
  const [document, setDocument] = useState(null);
  const [canView, setCanView] = useState(false);
  const userContext = useUserContext(); // Your hook to get user context
  
  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchDocument() {
      const doc = await getDocument(documentId);
      setDocument(doc);
      
      const result = evaluateAccess({
        context: userContext,
        resource: "documents",
        action: "read",
        record: doc
      });
      
      setCanView(result.can);
    }
    
    fetchDocument();
  }, [documentId, userContext]);
  
  if (!document) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!canView) return <div>You don't have permission to view this document.</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{document.title}</h1>
      <p>{document.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## How It Works

Under the hood, the auth-runner package:

1. Imports rules from both `@repo/auth-rbac` and `@repo/auth-abac`
2. Combines them into a single array of rules
3. Uses the evaluation engine from `@repo/auth-rbac` to process these rules

```typescript
// This is simplified version of what happens internally
import { rules as rbacRules } from "@repo/auth-rbac";
import { abacRules } from "@repo/auth-abac";
import { evaluateAccess as baseEvaluate } from "@repo/auth-rbac/engine/evaluate";

const combinedRules = [...rbacRules, ...abacRules];

export function evaluateAccess(params) {
  return baseEvaluate({
    rules: combinedRules,
    ...params
  });
}
```

## Benefits of Using Auth Runner

1. **Simplified API**: No need to manually combine rules or specify them with each evaluation
2. **Consistent Authorization**: Ensures all parts of your application use the same combined rule set
3. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Eliminates repetitive code for rule combination
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to rules in either system are automatically reflected

## Best Practices

1. **Use auth-runner consistently**: Replace direct usage of auth-rbac or auth-abac with auth-runner throughout your application
2. **Keep rule definitions separate**: Continue defining RBAC rules in auth-rbac and ABAC rules in auth-abac
3. **Consider rule precedence**: Rules are evaluated in order, so be mindful of how they're combined
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify that the combined rules produce the expected authorization decisions

## Example: Complete Authorization Flow

Here's a complete example of how authorization works with auth-runner in a typical zopio application:

1. Define your RBAC rules in auth-rbac (role-based permissions)
2. Define your ABAC rules in auth-abac (attribute-based conditions)
3. Use auth-runner to evaluate permissions throughout your application
4. The auth-runner package automatically combines and evaluates all rules

```typescript
// In your API route or component
import { evaluateAccess } from "@repo/auth-runner";

// User context with both role and attribute information
const userContext = {
  userId: "user-123",
  role: "editor",
  tenantId: "org-456",
  department: "marketing",
  region: "europe"
};

// Resource with relevant attributes
const document = {
  id: "doc-789",
  title: "Quarterly Report",
  ownerId: "user-123",
  department: "marketing",
  confidential: false
};

// Simple permission check that evaluates both RBAC and ABAC rules
const result = evaluateAccess({
  context: userContext,
  resource: "documents",
  action: "update",
  record: document
});

if (result.can) {
  // Proceed with update
}
```

This approach provides a clean, unified way to implement complex authorization logic that combines both role-based and attribute-based access control.
