# Authorization Logging For Audit Trail

The `@repo/auth-log` package provides a simple yet powerful way to log and monitor authorization attempts in your application. It integrates seamlessly with the authorization packages to create an audit trail of access control decisions.

## Overview

Authorization logging is a critical component of security monitoring and compliance. The `@repo/auth-log` package allows you to:

- **Track authorization decisions**: Log whether access was granted or denied
- **Record contextual information**: Capture user, resource, and action details
- **Customize logging destinations**: Output to console or file
- **Support compliance requirements**: Maintain audit trails for regulatory needs

## Installation

The package is included by default in the zopio stack. If you need to install it separately:

```bash
pnpm add @repo/auth-log
```

## Basic Usage

The auth-log package is designed to work seamlessly with the authorization packages:

```typescript
import { logAccessAttempt } from '@repo/auth-log';

// Log an authorization attempt
logAccessAttempt({
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  resource: 'article',
  action: 'read',
  context: { userId: '123', role: 'editor', tenantId: 'org-456' },
  recordId: '789',
  can: true
});
```

## Configuration

By default, logs are output to the console. You can configure the logging destination by setting the `AUTH_LOG_TARGET` environment variable:

```bash
# Log to console (default)
AUTH_LOG_TARGET=console

# Log to file
AUTH_LOG_TARGET=file

# Log to BetterStack
AUTH_LOG_TARGET=betterstack
BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN=your_source_token
```

When logging to a file, entries are appended to `./logs/access.log` by default.

When using BetterStack, you'll need to provide your source token via the `BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Log Format

Each log entry contains the following information:

- `timestamp`: When the authorization attempt occurred
- `resource`: The resource being accessed (e.g., 'article', 'user')
- `action`: The action being performed (e.g., 'read', 'update')
- `context`: User context information (userId, role, tenantId)
- `recordId`: Optional ID of the specific record being accessed
- `field`: Optional field name for field-level permissions
- `can`: Boolean indicating whether access was granted
- `reason`: Optional explanation for why access was denied

## Integration with Authorization Packages

The auth-log package is automatically integrated with the auth-runner package, which means all authorization checks performed through the runner will be logged without additional configuration.

```typescript
import { evaluateAccess } from '@repo/auth-runner/engine/evaluate';

// This will automatically log the access attempt
const result = evaluateAccess({
  context: { userId: '123', role: 'editor', tenantId: 'org-456' },
  resource: 'article',
  action: 'update',
  record: { id: '789', ownerId: '123' }
});
```

## Available Adapters

### Console Logger

The default adapter that outputs logs to the console:

```typescript
// Set via environment variable
AUTH_LOG_TARGET=console
```

### File Logger

Writes logs to a file on disk:

```typescript
// Set via environment variable
AUTH_LOG_TARGET=file
```

### BetterStack Logger

Sends logs to BetterStack's logging service for centralized log management:

```typescript
// Set via environment variables
AUTH_LOG_TARGET=betterstack
BETTERSTACK_SOURCE_TOKEN=your_source_token
```

The BetterStack adapter enriches logs with additional metadata:
- Sets log level to "info" for allowed access and "warn" for denied access
- Creates a formatted message for better readability
- Adds a service name for easier filtering

## Custom Adapters

You can create custom logging adapters by implementing the logger interface:

```typescript
const customLogger = {
  write: (entry: AccessLogEntry) => {
    // Custom logging logic here
    // e.g., send to a third-party service
  }
};

// Then register your custom logger in config.ts
export function getActiveLogger() {
  // Add your custom logger condition here
  if (process.env.AUTH_LOG_TARGET === "custom") {
    return customLogger;
  }
  
  // Existing conditions...
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Log all authorization attempts**: Enable comprehensive logging for security audits
2. **Monitor denied access**: Pay special attention to denied access attempts
3. **Rotate log files**: Implement log rotation for file-based logging
4. **Protect sensitive information**: Be careful not to log sensitive user data
5. **Review logs regularly**: Set up a process to review authorization logs
