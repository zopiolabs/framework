# Setting Up Trigger.dev Integration

This guide walks you through setting up the Trigger.dev integration in your Zopio application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A Trigger.dev account (sign up at [trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev))
2. Access to your Zopio application codebase

## Installation

The `@repo/trigger` package is already included in the Zopio monorepo. If you're working with a new package that needs to use Trigger.dev, add it as a dependency:

```bash
pnpm add @repo/trigger
```

## Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```
TRIGGER_API_KEY=your_trigger_dev_api_key
TRIGGER_API_URL=https://api.trigger.dev  # Optional, this is the default
```

You can find your API key in the Trigger.dev dashboard under Project Settings.

## Verifying Installation

To verify that the Trigger.dev integration is working correctly:

1. Make sure your application is running
2. Send a test event using the API endpoint
3. Check the Trigger.dev dashboard to see if the event was received

Example test request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "test.event", "payload": {"message": "Hello from Trigger.dev"}}'
```

## Webhook Configuration

For production environments, you'll need to configure the Trigger.dev webhook to point to your API endpoint:

1. Go to the Trigger.dev dashboard
2. Navigate to Project Settings > Webhooks
3. Add a new webhook with the URL: `https://your-domain.com/trigger`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the setup:

- Verify that your API key is correct
- Check that the API endpoint is accessible
- Review the server logs for any error messages
- Ensure that the Trigger.dev client is properly initialized

For more detailed troubleshooting, see the [Trigger.dev documentation](https://trigger.dev/docs/documentation/guides/troubleshooting).
