zopio is a production-grade [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com) template for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps. It is designed to be a comprehensive starting point for new apps, providing a solid, opinionated foundation with a minimal amount of configuration.

It is a culmination of my experience building web apps over the last decade and is designed to help you build your new SaaS app as thoroughly as possible, balancing speed and quality.

## Demo

We have a demo version of zopio that you can use to get a feel for the project!
