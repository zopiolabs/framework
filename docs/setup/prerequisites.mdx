description: How to configure your development environment for zopio.

## Operating System

zopio is designed to work on macOS, Linux and Windows. While zopio itself is platform-agnostic, the tooling and dependencies we use have different requirements.

## Package Manager

zopio defaults to using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager, but you can use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) instead by passing a flag during the [installation](/setup/installation) step.

## Stripe CLI

We use the Stripe CLI to forward [payments webhooks](/packages/payments#webhooks) to your local machine.

## Mintlify CLI

We use the Mintlify CLI to preview the [docs](/apps/docs) locally.
