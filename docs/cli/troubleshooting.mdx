# Troubleshooting

This guide provides solutions for common issues you might encounter when using the Zopio CLI.

## Common Issues

### Command Not Found

**Issue**: The `zopio` command is not recognized.

**Solutions**:
1. If installed globally, ensure it's in your PATH:
   ```bash
   npm list -g zopio-cli
   ```

2. Use npx to run the CLI:
   ```bash
   npx zopio-cli [command]
   ```

3. Check if the CLI is installed in your project:
   ```bash
   npm list zopio-cli
   ```

### Internationalization Issues

#### Missing Translation Files

**Issue**: The CLI reports missing translation files or directories.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your project structure includes the required directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p dictionaries/en locales
   ```

2. Initialize the i18n configuration:
   ```bash
   zopio config --init
   zopio i18n --create common
   ```

#### Locale Not Recognized

**Issue**: A locale you're trying to use is not recognized.

**Solutions**:
1. Check the supported locales in your i18nConfig.ts:
   ```bash
   cat i18nConfig.ts
   ```

2. Add the locale using the CLI:
   ```bash
   zopio i18n --add [locale]
   ```

3. Manually update your i18nConfig.ts file to include the locale.

#### Translation Keys Not Synchronized

**Issue**: Translation keys are missing in some locales.

**Solution**: Use the i18n-sync command to synchronize keys across locales:
```bash
zopio i18n-sync
```

### Plugin Issues

#### Plugin Not Loading

**Issue**: A plugin you've installed is not being loaded.

**Solutions**:
1. Check the plugin location:
   ```bash
   ls -la .zopio/plugins/
   ls -la $HOME/.zopio/plugins/
   ```

2. Ensure the plugin file has the correct format and exports a default function.

3. Check for errors in the plugin code.

#### Plugin Command Conflicts

**Issue**: Multiple plugins define commands with the same name.

**Solution**: The CLI uses the following precedence order for plugins:
1. Project-specific plugins
2. User-specific plugins
3. Built-in plugins

Rename your plugin command to avoid conflicts.

### Code Generation Issues

#### Generated Code Not Working

**Issue**: Components or modules generated by the CLI have errors.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're using the correct command and options.

2. Check if your custom templates have syntax errors.

3. Verify that all required dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install next-intl next-international
   ```

#### Internationalization Not Working in Generated Components

**Issue**: Components with the `--i18n` flag don't properly use translations.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your project has the required i18n setup:
   ```bash
   zopio i18n --list
   ```

2. Create the necessary translation namespace:
   ```bash
   zopio i18n --create [component-name]
   ```

3. Check that your app is properly configured to use next-intl or next-international.

### Configuration Issues

#### Config File Not Found

**Issue**: The CLI reports that the configuration file is not found.

**Solutions**:
1. Initialize the configuration:
   ```bash
   zopio config --init
   ```

2. Specify a custom config path:
   ```bash
   ZOPIO_CONFIG_PATH=./custom-config.js zopio [command]
   ```

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Debugging the CLI

To get more detailed output from the CLI, you can enable debug mode:

```bash
DEBUG=zopio:* zopio [command]
```

### Resetting the CLI

If you encounter persistent issues, you can reset the CLI configuration:

1. Remove project-specific configuration:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .zopio zopio.config.js
   ```

2. Reinitialize the project:
   ```bash
   zopio init
   ```

### Checking CLI Version Compatibility

Ensure you're using a compatible version of the CLI:

```bash
zopio --version
```

Compare this with the version specified in your project's package.json.
