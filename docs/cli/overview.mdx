# Zopio CLI

The Zopio CLI is a powerful command-line interface designed to streamline development workflows when building applications with the Zopio framework. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for project initialization, code generation, internationalization management, and more. The CLI is now fully implemented in TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience.

## Key Features

- **Project Initialization**: Quickly bootstrap new Zopio projects with the recommended structure
- **Code Generation**: Generate modules, components, and other code artifacts with best practices built in
- **Internationalization Support**: Manage translations and locales for your application
- **Configuration Management**: Easily configure your Zopio projects
- **Background Jobs**: Create and manage background jobs with internationalization support
- **Plugin System**: Extend the CLI with custom plugins
- **CRUD Operations**: Generate complete CRUD functionality including schemas, UI components, validation, and tests
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript implementation for better type safety and developer experience

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g zopio-cli

# Or use with npx
npx zopio-cli [command]
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize a new project
zopio init

# Generate a new component with i18n support
zopio component UserProfile --i18n

# Add a new locale
zopio i18n --add fr

# Create a new background job
zopio jobs --create user-notifications
```

## Architecture

The Zopio CLI follows a modular architecture that makes it easy to extend and customize:

```
framework/cli/
├── commands/        # Command implementations
├── templates/       # Code templates
├── utils/           # Helper utilities
├── plugins/         # Plugin system
└── zopio.js         # Main entry point
```
